# WinSoftwareUpdate
This module will let you update your installed software with WinGet, many of them but not all. The complete list is published here: [WinGet Repo](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli)  
This module is perfect for people like me that are to lazy to update every singel software all the time, it's much easier to just run a PowerShell Script.  
I have added the result from PSScriptAnalyzer in [test folder](https://github.com/rwidmark/WinSoftwareUpdate/tree/main/test) I have some ShouldProcess warnings in this module but that's nothing to worry about really.

## This module can do the following
- Check what platform your currently running and adapt the downloads for that, if your running x86, amd64, arm64.
- Make sure that you have WinGet installed and up to date, if it's not the module will install / update it for you to the latest version.
- Make sure that you have Microsoft.VCLibs installed, if not the module will install it for you.
- If your running this module with PowerShell 7 this module will check if PowerShell 7 have any newer versions, and if it's any newer version it will download and update PowerShell 7
- Update all your softwares with WinGet
